<h1 class="h1">PET SHOP BOYS - THE CLEVEREST MEN IN POP</h1>

    Thirty-five years after Pet Shop Boys scored their first significant hit, they occupy a unique and pretty enviable place in the pop landscape. They’re the banger-crafting lovable uncles who keep their fingers on the musical pulse, while maintaining the mystique of performers from a different era. “Their detached and ambivalent approach to success is refreshing at a time where so many artists are clamouring for attention in digital spaces,” says Dr Kirsty Fairclough from the University of Salford’s School of Arts and Media.
    
    But although Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe don’t post on social media (other than through carefully-curated official accounts), they remain an immediately recognisable pop partnership. Close your eyes and you can picture them standing side by side – they may or may not be wearing statement hats, but Lowe will definitely be in shades.</p>

    <p>Since they broke through with West End Girls, which reached number one in the US and UK in 1986, Tennant and Lowe have displayed a masterly ability to weave both social commentary and political satire into their infectious electro-pop songs. As Fairclough puts it, they've managed to achieve a “rare combination of huge commercial success with an intelligent approach to creating pop music which has consistently commented on the cultural moment”.</p>

    <p>Tennant has always been the duo’s more prominent member, as befits his role as frontman, but Harnell says Lowe’s contribution shouldn’t be underestimated. Like any great partnership, one half complements the other. “Chris Lowe has always maintained strong links with club culture, and is arguably a little underrated in the way that he’s kept the duo’s music sounding fresh and relevant to a new generation of fans,” he suggests. Lowe’s love of club and youth culture comes to the fore on 1986’s Paninaro, one of the few Pet Shop Boys songs in which he provides the majority of the vocals. This club-ready banger was inspired by the ‘paninari’, a 1980s Italian youth subculture who were defined by their love of designer clothing and an ostentatious, high-consumption lifestyle.

    <p>Aston says that over 35 years, the Pet Shop Boys have “embodied what the best pop music is all about – something that can be celebrated on the surface, or [on a] deeper [level], should the listener choose to dig”. It’s difficult to disagree with this conclusion. You don’t need to know that Being Boring, a song which enjoyed only modest chart success when it was released in 1990, but is now widely acknowledged as one of the Pets’ very best, was inspired by a quote from US socialite Zelda Fitzgerald, or that Tennant wrote the lyrics about a friend who died of Aids. But once you do, its immaculate melody and relatively understated production become even more moving. It’s a quintessential example of Tennant and Lowe condensing really quite a lot into perfectly-formed pop music.</p>
