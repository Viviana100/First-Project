<p>From their first single "West End Girls", which immediately topped the British charts, to the recently released "Dreamland", the success runs through the almost 40-year-old work of the Pet Shop Boys. There is a reason for this: Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe have always remained true to themselves and have always kept their elegant style. In January 2020, “Hotspot”, the 14th studio album has been released. The Pet Shop Boys are coming to the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Berlin on June 12, 2021 on their "Dreamworld - The Greatest Hits Live" tour and will present a best-of-setlist for the first time in their careers.</p>
